My name's Mahdi; I have a quiet strong background in statistics and data analysis.
and have been using Stata for several years to conduct research and complete
data projects. I am well-versed in a variety of Stata commands and techniques,
and have experience working with large datasets. In addition, I have experience
creating Stata scripts and macros, which allows me to automate repetitive tasks
and make my work more efficient. I have worked with large scale datasets that
are globally renowned. I have done a project using the REGPAT data which covers
all the patents in the world. I have also worked with the HAN, and ORBIS databeses.

\par

More about my programming \& quantitative skills. I have an excellent experience
with Python, working with databases, deep learning models, image processing,
statistical analyses, and almost all sorts of things in Python. In my current
role as a data analyst, I have honed my skills in Python and have become an
professional. I Also, have worked with R for the purpose of statistical analyses,
statistical modeling and data visualization.

\par

Recently, I graduated with a Master's in Theoretical Economics from TeIAS (Tehran
Institute for Advanced Studies, the leading economic/financial research institute
in Iran). I've been researching Economics \&
also doing RA jobs at TeIAS for the last three years. I have been the RA of Mahdi Heidari for almost 30 months, also I've done RA jobs
with Hamed Davari from the university of Mannheim, Germany.
moreover, I have an ongoing RA job with Javad Shamsi from LSE, UK.
Before my Maser's in Economics, I graduated from the Electrical Engineering Department
of Sharif university of technology, which is a renowned department worldwide.
I enhanced my mathematical \& quantitative skills during these years.

\par

I have done many projects in \textbf{Stata}, \textbf{Python}, \textbf{R} and
\textbf{Julia}. As an example of my works, I extracted
share-holding data from Iranian mutual funds’ reports’ images, which is
brave new nationwide. I used image processing methods, the TableNet deep
learning model with some adjustments, and the Google Tesseract engine for the job.
I have done a project using Python in which I have used the Selenium library to scrape data from the
Tehran Stock Exchange website. The project gatheres all the prices, adjusted prices,
and other trade information about the stocks in the TSE, then it cleanes data
and add it to an online database.

\par

I believe that my previous quantitative \& mathematical skills,
as well as my excellence in programming with Stata \& Python,
makes me the right candidate for the predoctoral position.
I hope to work on this research project to strengthen
my skills \& deepen my knowledge so I can develop my research agenda and get
a Ph.D. in economics at a leading university.

Please review my CV for additional details. Do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further
clarification on my experience.
